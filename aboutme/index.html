        <h2>Lucas Puggina</h2>
        <h2>Also known as Lucat</h2>
        <p>My name is Lucas Puggina, I am from Brazil and I am 28 years old.
            I come from a big family of seven siblings, two girls and five boys including me. I served as a missionary
            in Brazil Teresina Mission, and I loved the time which I served in my country.
            Iam married to a wonderful woman called Sabrina, she also served a mission in Salt Lake City Temple Square.
            We did the Pathway Connect Program together a couple years ago, and we learned so much as a family.
            So I decided to study at BYU online because I would like to continue to have this same approach and
            standards in my life, as I strive to become self reliant.
            I love technology and to follow up every new chipset or any kind of news about it. I love games too, my
            favorites are theopen world action RPG or the adventurous ones.
            I also enjoy watching tv shows like The Office, Modern Family, and Animes which I think is my addiction.
            I love my Lord Jesus Christ. I seek to follow His example, know Him and be like Him. I have a deep respect
            for his Atoning Sacrifice and His Restored Gospel.
            I am here to continue my journey towards education and self reliance, I am open to learn and participate
            with my classmates.</p>
