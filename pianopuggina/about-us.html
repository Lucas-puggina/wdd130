                        This is the man, Who inherited all the knowledge we have about pianos from his father and grandfather.
                          He started to work at 12 year old. He loved to assist his old man by bringing some tools and observing everything  He was doing.
                          After some time he learned for himself  how to play piano, and his father began to teach how to tune and gave him all the tricks he developed through his life.
                         And now he is passing this unique knowledge to his sons and daughters that work with him.
