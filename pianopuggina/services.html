                <p class="pg3"> Here is again tuning a great grand piano. This is one of the most difficult things about pianos: they have an average of 225 wires and they receive a tension force of 200 kg. This makes the wire easily change its tune at the smallest temperature change.
                    It is a very dedicated job, and our tuner technician LÃ©lio Puggina finishes his work with an average of one or two hours.</p>

                <img class="trans-img" src="images/transport2.jpg" alt="piano very protected">
                    <p class="pg3"> Here you can have an example of how careful we are with your instrument. This picture was taken after our team went down six flights of stairs. The piano did not suffer any kind of damage inside or outside. We are very careful .
                    These transports are realized by two expecialists with a help of a strap on theirs back that give them the mobility and comfort to do the necessary maneuvers even the piano having  an average 250kg.

                <img class="imun-img" src="images/imunization1.jpg" alt="A hole in the floor of the piano">
                <p class="pg3">Another very common, however complicated problem with pianos are the termites. They are like cancer on your instrument, if you don't realize in time, maybe you have already lost your piano.
                    Immunization is a challenging work because we need to track the termites until reach the queen, because in other way they will never really leave your instrument. Through a lot of trying we develop our own way to cure your instrument from this cancer.
